The main document is Training-openondemand.html (or Training-openondemand_slides.html if you prefer a version that appears in slide-show format rather than as one long HTML page).

To directly view the HTML, please click [here](https://github.com/lbnl-science-it/Training-OpenOnDemand/blob/main/Training-openondemand.md)

This material will also be available at http://scs.lbl.gov/getting-help
